This quiz was my final project for Electronic Business course. The point of the quiz is to test the "player's" knowledge of the entrance exam material for the faculty. 
I have posted multiple modules for the project but the main ones are Projekat.ui and pitanja.csv. 
Projekat.ui integrates all the functions within a single function plus the UI done in PyQt5. I have uploaded a couple more functions with the main one but those serve as "beta" functions that were used as something I have built on from.
pitanja.csv is the database module that contains official questions that the player will face should he choose to take the general knowledge exam for enrolling FON.

The quiz pulls questions from the module with the first question always being correct. The questions are then randomized within the question and then all the question are being randomized, providing maximum authenticity to the exam. 

This is my first project in Python and I intend to keep working on it by adding multiple modules and other options as well as improving UI. 

For any further questions feel free to contact me. :)
